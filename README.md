Gamification

In my Information and Reference Services module, there is an element of gamification in the use of e-tutorials. These are a part of the assessment for the module, completed through blackboard. So, for example, an e-tutorial on finding factual information will bring you through steps teaching you how to go about searching for information. The tutorial is followed by a quiz you must complete to 100% and an e-certificate is given to mark your completion of the e-tutorial.

So this uses this small element of challenge to encourage completion of the tasks. Similarly, this idea could be applied to other classes. Last year, one of my archaeology classes set us a group task with an element of competition and acting, to engage us in the study of Archaeological schools of thought. The groups gave presentations in character and one group was judged winners.

There are other kinds of gamification I think could be used well in courses. Letâ€™s say a course has 4 assignments each counting for 25% of the grade. Completion of each assignment represents a completion of one quarter of the course and achievements could be based on this. So when the student completes an assignment they receive a reward, like a virtual medal or certificate, saying they achieved a grade in this portion of the module.
